During the Christmas vacations in the family house in Brittany, my mother shows me a basket containing a whole selection of toys from our childhood, which she thinks are good to throw away because they are all more or less damaged, broken. But as she wouldn't throw anything away without asking us, they have survived to this day. I decide to photograph them. I improvise a mini-studio in the open air on the terrace in front of the room and I photograph this collection of objects on a white background. I find a few others who come to join the group, 120 in total. I am conscious of saving them by photographing them, they become survivors, and since the whole thing enters the BNF collections after the exhibition, it worked well. A survival of forgotten objects that belonged to the plastic generation of the early 1960s suddenly find themselves before our eyes.
