Derives from two yellow roses protruding from a garden and picked. I photograph them, and a work of fusions, collages, juxtapositions of petal material follows. Two series result from this. In the first one, a surface is composed from a square fragment, according to a process similar to the one that gave birth to the Apple Peels. In the other one, improbable flower hybrids are created.
