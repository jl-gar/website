I buy a Nikon Coolpix, 3M pixels, and everything can be photographed, in any position, it doesn't cost anything, and the images accumulate in the computers' memories. What interests me is to talk about this fluidity. I then begin a series of digital collages based on this photographic material, seeking to retranscribe moments that have existed. Knowing that they are only passages, constantly changing balances. The cuts have both the solidity of a finished form and the fragility of an improbable assemblage. Each one is a simple transition point in the great future.
