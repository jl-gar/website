Commission for the European Photography Week in Reggio-Emilia. Theme: Europe and its mixed populations. 

A very short deadline for the realisation. We noticed that in our staircase, several nationalities were present. With a large format camera, I photograph the groups of inhabitants in their living rooms, plus a view of the staircase. Except that no one is photographed at home. As a trap, the photographs are analysed, the couple of decor - inhabitants on presuppositions. And the interpretations are often wrong.
