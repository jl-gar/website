I look at the selection of photographs of leaves on the ground made in recent days. A dispersion according to the circumstances, democratic, each element has its place and importance in the composition. The perspective is abolished in this frontal plane of the ground, the glance is incited to move continuously from an element to another. As in my drawings or in other series of photographs, I think of the Disorders for example. I am probably collecting here the experience of composition on a sheet of paper. Nature thwarted by the tarmac of men, its miraculous beauty on this non-receptive surface, uniform and sterile in its refusal to integrate the cycle of living degradation of these leaves. Gravity and grace, and the tarmac. Images made in the near environment, no particular displacement, carbon footprint, the obsession of the moment, reduced to subsistence. The world is going badly, the climate crisis, war, famine and all the other misfortunes of this world are reminded to us every day and overwhelm us, however autumn is coming, the leaves are falling, I eat, I live, I spend time looking for these images that I select with great care. Derisory? Wozu Dichter in dürftiger Zeit?
