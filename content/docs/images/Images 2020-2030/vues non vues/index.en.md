In the spring of 2020, we are living the unprecedented experience of a confinement. One hour out of the house is allowed every day within a one- kilometre radius, remaining 23 hours in the flat. I often look out of the window at the few isolated passers-by, at the families carefully grouped together on their daily outings, and then I start to photograph them. Later on, I have the idea of making a series of photographs over a given period of time, I stand at the window, determine the precise frame of the shots, and photograph every passer-by, cyclist, group, one click for each. With this basic material I start a montage. I take fragments containing the passers-by, and then transfer them to exactly the same place in the final montage. In this way I compose a scene that never took place. I recreate a collective that has completely disappeared from our lives during this confinement. But in each final image, you can feel the solitude of the characters, the others do not exist, each one remains in his own world. An impression of strangeness seizes us in front of this choreography so precisely arranged. The tree continues its development in the cycle of the seasons, indifferent to this human agitation.
