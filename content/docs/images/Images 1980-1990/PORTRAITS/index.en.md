At night, under a street lighting lamp, a stool faces a photographic large format camera on a tripod, slightly overhanging. A person sits facing the camera. I press the shutter release, the exposure will last about two minutes, I walk while listening to the sounds of the city.
It is not strictly speaking a portrait, each person is going to give his or her photograph to the camera, which will record it on the negative. No psychology, an anonymous portrait, the long explosure time makes the characteristics fade away, clothes, facial features, remains the so intense gaze staring at the lens, the pupil records the movements of the head due to the light point of the lamp reflection.
