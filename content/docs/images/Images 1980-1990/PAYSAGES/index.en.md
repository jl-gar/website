1985, 31 years old, my first photographs as a photographer, any other activity, courses in adult education, is abandoned. I join the second year the team of photographers constituted for this commission of the Photographic Mission of the DATAR. A first three-month contract: to take photographs in the industrial areas of Albi-Carmaux and Decazeville, then in Lyon and its suburbs. The following year a subject that I propose, landscapes in transformation, six months contract. A car, the 4x5 camera, France as a field of exploration. Total commitment, founding encounters with artists. These places in transformation, what they were tends to be forgotten, what they will become is not yet very clear, for a short time they float in a certain indecision.
