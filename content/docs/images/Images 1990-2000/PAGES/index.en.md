Continuation of the exploration of the house at first, the children are young, and constitution of a set of images. Assemblages of these photographs in collages that will constitute a kind of diary of a life, that of our family. She lives there. Then comes the search for the surface of computer code taken from the computer's memory, an image of what is present, but indecipherable unless we have the codes, the instruments, the necessary knowledge. The image of everything that surrounds us, crosses us, the waves of the universe, telephones, televisions, radios. The site of a life in the world. Visible and invisible coexist in these two juxtaposed pages.
