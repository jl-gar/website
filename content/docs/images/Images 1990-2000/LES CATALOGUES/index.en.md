Catalogues - 1991

I collect art catalogues with anonymous covers, if possible, and photograph them with a 4x5" view camera. The piece consists of 60 photographs. For the installation, the frames are turned against the wall, one of them is taken and hung at the top left, the line of 15 is continued, the next one is taken, and the last one is placed in the bottom right corner. Each time it is presented, the piece will be different. The feeling for the photographer of coming after the presence of humans, the construction of cities, the production of objects, the manufacture of clothing, the creation of works of art.
