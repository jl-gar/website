A commission originally for a work installed in Pau in an engineering school for industrial processes. After all, they are working for us, even against us, if we think of all these molecules that have come to encumber the space of industrial production in recent decades. But what can photography do, just flirt with the surfaces of uncertain bodies, with invisible chemistries. At the time of the so-called mad cow crisis, it is not photography that can tell us whether or not there are prions in our meat. I explore the house, like all houses, they put our bodies in contact with materials, which touch our skins, which we breathe, eat, or simply look at. I decompose into simple elements this close universe, one material per image, and I recompose small sets that reconstitute a sometimes enigmatic environment. These simple elements surround us in the exhibition room. And in the school, I set up a few sets in the hope that these future engineers will ask themselves some questions about what will happen to the products that will come out of their industrial processes and with which they themselves will be individually confronted afterwards.
