For almost four years, I collected the photographs that passed through my hands, without doing any specific research. They came from different sources, some of them I took, others I found in newspapers or magazines, invitation cards received or collected during exhibition visits, various cards, which I assembled and then glued together on large pages. I kept this kind of image journal, a shaping of the flow of images that has gone through life during these years.
