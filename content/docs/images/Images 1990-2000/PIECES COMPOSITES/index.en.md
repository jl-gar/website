Combining multiple photographs to make a work of art starts with two. The pictures must not be so perfect that they are self-sufficient. So I had to learn to make them in such a way that they can be associated with each other as much by what they show and their colors as by what they lack. A kind of silent writing is deciphered by the eye of the viewer.

A period, corresponding to the birth of our first child and then a move, when the camera rarely left the flat. I started to compose these Suites of 5 photographs, no more, feeling that to percieve them as a single piece became too difficult with a larger number of pictures. It is not a diary of our life, it is a use of what is close to talk about the passage from life to work. The moment of taking the photograph is the tipping point of the moment of life in the time of the work, if at least this photograph later becomes part of the work. The photographer experiences this melancholic vertigo at each release, the tipping point of the present moment in the future time. These Suites write about this situation. The composition of each of them establishes links between the subjects, the colours, the sizes of the photographs, to make it autonomous and perceptible at first glance as a whole and not as a series of independent pictures. This reading, which became obvious about ten years after their creation, was not at all evident in their first exhibition.
