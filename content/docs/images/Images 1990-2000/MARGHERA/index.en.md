A commission in which I find the Americans, Sephen Shore, Lewis Baltz, john Gossage, Frank Gohlke, Anthony Hernandez, Richard Pare, and also John Davies. A certain emotion. Today, artists are no longer invited to paint works for prestigious places, they are asked to frequent and work in places of industrial decline. What they had begun to do with themselves, on the other hand. No authorisations, the public space, the freest one suits me. Several landscapes recomposed from photographs taken in different places and a diptych with a child. In this space where men have destroyed all beauty, the water is oily, the waste is scattered in the thin grass, the air smells of industrial dust, the sounds of scrap metal dumped on a quay assault, the child takes a piece of brick and draws a boat on a stone. He has the resource to create a world for himself, in a place where we are annihilated.
