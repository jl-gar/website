Commission during the renovation of the first wing of the Saint-Pierre Museum in Lyon. Several states of this transformation are captured in sets of photographs, from the old to the new. Then are added a few photographs taken outside the museum, yellow of the forsythias in spring and a mother with a child. A piece is then written, including an exhibition device, a structure made for the occasion, an interior where the photographs taken outside the museum are shown, and an exterior where those taken inside the museum are visible.
