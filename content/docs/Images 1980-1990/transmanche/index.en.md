Commission  following the DATAR Photographic Mission. Another transformation of the territory. I chose to work on  the tunnel construction site, the interior being almost inaccessible for work with a tool such as the large format camera. I am first interested in the objects scattered on the open-air site, then in the workers, and finally by the sea. From a distance, while I am a resident at the Chartreuse in Villeneuve-lez-Avignon, I realise that this very specific and extraordinary building site, the construction of the famous Channel Tunnel, escapes the photographs.
So I conceived this series of diptychs, each one integrating a view of the sea, figures corresponding to the data of the project engraved on the glass, superimposed on the sea view, and two workers working nearby. In the catalogue, I write down the stages of the process that led me to conceive these pieces.
