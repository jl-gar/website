As a following of the changing landscapes, my interest is once again focused on what has not become fixed in form or immutable, these disorders. Interiors, where the fixed structure, architecture, furniture layout, is kept at a distance, is contested by objects, things, clothes placed here or there, without any desire for composition. I note these states. Photographic writing has meant that many times I have been asked if these photographs were not staged. When you make a photograph, you carry out a process of recomposition in real time. And that's what gives the impression of a possible staging. The way of dealing with colours also contributes to this feeling of being faced with a recomposition.
