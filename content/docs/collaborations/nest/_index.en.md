One day in 1999, I received a fax from New York asking me if I was Jean-Louis Garnell, the author of the acclaimed Désordres series. I replied that one can never be sure who one is, but that I was indeed the author of these photographs, while thanking the correspondent for her proposal to collaborate with the magazine nest, founded by Joseph Holtzman, which had just begun its adventure. A little later, I received the first two issues and we began to consider projects. Nine more followed, all published in the magazine. Each time, it was like discovering a unique universe. Then came the pleasure of seeing the images printed alongside a collection of always surprising subjects, with an inventive layout. After more than twenty issues, the adventure I was so happy to be a part of came to an end.
