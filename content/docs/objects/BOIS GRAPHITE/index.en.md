| [Bois graphités - Lead pencil on woods 2010-2011](BOISGRAPHITES.html)







On the way from the flat to the workshop, I pick up different things, and I begin to take an interest in used pieces of wood, whose original function is not very obvious. I am particularly careful in my choice of dimensions and shapes. After various experiments, I begin to cover the visible surface very completely with graphite. The wood is hidden under this grey layer, which is very sensitive to light reflections. They have a second life, saved in extremis from destruction, probably by fire. They are then hung on the wall, present in their erasure. I think that the gesture of covering the surface with graphite is similar to that of the photographer who unifies all the surfaces of matter present in reality, and which become, in the image, the surface of photographic paper.
