## Book publishing project


Once again, I explore the close. And this had begun long before the lockdown rules imposed on us this year, the first Suites named ici-même - right here date from 1993-1994. It is always with astonishment that new images appear. One might think that habit dulls the gaze and makes one want to travel far away to re-sharpen it. I would tend to think the opposite, it is the very fact itself of not moving that makes any new circumstance so strong, it is hard to believe that it is still possible for this new one to emerge in this so well known continuum. All it takes is a light on that day, at that moment, falling on those things put there, in that singular configuration, to make you want to go and get the camera and take that photograph which will also be unique. I have learned that these precise circumstances will never happen again. In this project, I retain photographs that show precisely the organic link that is established between what is seen and the light. Something very intimate, beyond what is personal and of little importance, is unveiled from this existing in here.
