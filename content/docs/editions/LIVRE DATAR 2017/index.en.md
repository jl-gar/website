# LANDSCAPES 1985 – 1986 / Mission photographique de la DATAR





At the end of 2016, two exhibition projects initiated by Raphaële Bertho and Héloïse Conésa are planned. They both relate to La Mission photographique de la DATAR, which encourages me to revisit my work of 1985-1986. In general I don't do this, I think that the choices decided in real time are those that really commit us. But here I make an exception. I revisit the contact sheets, scan hundreds of negatives and begin to arrange the double-pages that will lead to this book project, which is still unpublished. Many aspects of my work are now visible. They complement and broaden the vision that one could have had by looking at the limited set that I had selected as a direct result of the fieldwork, almost 35 years ago now.
