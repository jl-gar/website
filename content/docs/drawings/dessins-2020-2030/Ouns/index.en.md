Series of 28 drawings, 50x35cm or 35x50cm, watercolour and pigments on paper

A first fragile humanoid character with multiple internal wounds appeared in Brittany during the drawing session on 23 July. A kind of self-portrait, I thought. It remained unique, I framed it and hung it on the wall here for a while. The terrible attack by Hamas on 7 October and the appalling violence of the Israeli response in Gaza reawakened our sense of inner fragility. This was compounded by the ongoing war in Ukraine and various other current conflicts. The characters reappeared in the wake of these events, and the series continued. I kept them all, without selecting any, and arranged them in the order in which they were created. A solitary figure floats in a white space, barely standing, taking a few last steps before collapsing, or caught in the fall, or still a mass on the ground. Sometimes they make demonstrative gestures, calls for help addressed to no one in particular, their limbs may be dislocated, and on all of them, the coloured areas, where red dominates, suggest numerous serious and often fatal injuries. Even if we are not the direct victims of these crimes, we are affected and wounded in our humanity by the terrible violence inflicted on humans by humans. These drawings express and show, between reality and metaphor, the state in which we find ourselves. In utter disarray.
