It started with this shape I spotted in a previous drawing, a kind of human- tree standing leaning, in black and green, it unfolded in very fine subtle lines reminiscent of molds or roots, both downwards and upwards. I started making new ones, on 50x35cm formats, one per sheet. The passage to a larger format changed the relationship to the lines of the original, another energy had to develop. I determined the colors, four for all. The 22 forms are certainly part of the same series, all of them show this human-tree, but each one has its own character which it manifests with more or less vehemence. From the ground rose this trunk, sometimes in two parts, a hollow in the center, almost split, and which arrives after years of life and growth to this state in this present where it is plunged in a great indecision. Can it still grow, simply grow? What will happen now? What possibility of life remains? A great uncertainty hovers over the future of these beings. That of the trees? My own?
