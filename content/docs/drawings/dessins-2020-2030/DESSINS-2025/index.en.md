Reduce, he says

One year, the table here, no trips, one or two drawings each day, all in the same format, 36x51cm, rather modest.
Photography is an instantaneous snapshot cut in the flow of reality, its surface is always full of the substance of the world transmitted by light. In contrast, the sheet of paper on the table in the morning is immaculate, it will collect an ecology of traces while preserving part of its initial whiteness. A figuration may appear, without any real prior intention. Traces made with brushes combining pieces of wire, strings of various thicknesses, and plant elements taken from the surrounding area, such as handles made from bamboo pruning residues.
