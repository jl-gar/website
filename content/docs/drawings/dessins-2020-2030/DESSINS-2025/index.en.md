For almost five years now, I have been practising drawing on a regular basis. They are dated, carefully archived, several hundred of them today. Drawings are physical phenomena that take place on the sheet of paper, the theatre of operations. Flows, contacts, diffusions, captures, mutual exchanges of material, encounters, oppositions, distances, tensions, fusions. A whole life in action, at an elementary or metaphorical stage. Between the done and the not done, between what is decisions and the uncontrollable consequences of these decisions. Perhaps they are trying to get to the bottom of my thoughts, my feelings, something that lives, a fusional mixture of constraints and freedom, of the random and the necessary. A perpetual exchange of organic and mineral substances which is the essence of life. And us a very short moment in this continuum, the time to do and to leave some traces that express it. The movement is perceptible in these sets of forms and it seems frozen in a fraction of a second, as in a photograph.
