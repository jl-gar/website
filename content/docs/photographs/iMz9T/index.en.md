Under this code name are revealed 9 unknown images, which have just been completed in a secret laboratory. Even if you look at them carefully, their origin is so uncertain that it is almost impossible to know how they were made. They are there rather soft in their presence. The materials that constitute them remain impossible to define, are they natural but of what nature would we speak then? Or results of sophisticated combinations of industrial chemistry which would have concocted organic and synthetic fabrics as precise as improbable? They cannot have been made or painted by hand as the details of the textures are so precise, and their smooth and perfect surface confesses a certain technical origin. One could make the hypothesis that they are photographs, but what would be the origin necessarily in the real world for any photograph? Or to think that they are synthetic images, totally made by computer, but then this precision of the matters would dissuade us again, no it is not possible. Then remains a last possibility, they would be all that at the same time, an intimate fusion of real materiality and digital processes. Living and dead, animal and artificial, found and manufactured, their ambivalence resists any classification. These are resolutely contemporary images, stemming from our reality combining the organic of the world we live in and the virtuality of the ever more invasive digital. We are in front of them facing a dilemma that we cannot decide, invited to share their mystery, which is also that of our present life.
