Commissioned by the Stadtwerke Saarbrücken, the region's energy supplier, on the initiative of Kasper König. The subject: a thermal power station including four in situ commissions to artists. The photographic commission comes in a second step. I live alone in a water tower, necessarily on a hilltop with a view of the industrial landscape, in the first lodge to contemplate the storms. I mix the different components related to this commission and I constitute a set of 24 photographs, a meditation on my presence in these places devoted to the production of electricity.
