Started without my noticing it, a series of photographs will grow and then be arranged to become this piece in four parts of 16 photographs each. Meticulous attention is paid to the relationship between light, objects, the things closest to us, in our living space. The four sets correspond to the seasons, from the intimate connection of shadows and objects in the weak light of winter mornings, to the more colourful light of autumn, through its rise in spring, the colours appear more distinctly, summer is characterised by the intensity of contrasts, the vividness of colours and the strength of the call of the outside world.
