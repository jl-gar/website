I collect things gleaned here and there, chosen for their particular qualities, size, colour, but also silence or enigma. Then begins the work of composition on the wall of the studio, which continues while I make new discoveries. Numerous attempts, elements are removed, added, moved, transformed. An impression of flow, which would have frozen like life in a photograph, is given by these compositions. A meticulous description of all the elements composing each of these 5 Walls accompanies them.
