During one of my last stays in the family home, I found the boxes of photographs I was making and shooting in a small lab in the basement. Preserved since the beginning of the 70s, they contain prints bearing their age and revealing my first tests. It is the set concerning situations related to music that caught my attention. I made these collages from the prints I found, and each of them is linked to a particular circumstance that is associated with a record. There is a contrast between the amateurism of the photographer and the musicians, and the professionalism, the celebrity of the records and the musicians facing each other in each diptych.
