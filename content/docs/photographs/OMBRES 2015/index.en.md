I took a blank sheet of watercolor paper similar to the ones I used this summer for the series of drawings made during the stay in the cabin by the lake. I placed this sheet in the northern nature, often near trees lying in the wind and I photographed it by choosing very precisely the shadow drawing while keeping around it a frame made of various components of the surrounding nature. This surface that reveals is also a screen that hides a certain amount of nature. The sheet collects the shadow drawing, the photograph collects the whole. These two collections are present in each photograph, facing each other.
