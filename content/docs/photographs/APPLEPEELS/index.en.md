The children are still small, I peel the reinette apples for the whole family, the plate of peels pleases me and with an Olympus Camédia 1.2M pixels, the top of the technique, I photograph it a little later on the balcony, in the sunlight. I repeat the operation, other days, other apples, other peels. From this material, I start to take parts of it, to stick them one on top of the other, to mix them in different ways. Then I select a square fragment that will be used as the basis for the copy-paste-mirror process, resulting in images measuring 120x120 cm. A main motif will appear 9 times. I think that the square with the 9 patterns allows the result to be an image with a certain fence and not a carpet. A man locks himself in with his computer to produce this series, the world disappears. The most organic, our food, at least what is left of it, here the peelings, becomes a digital surface, a new computer- generated skin that carries the memory of its organic matter, Apple Peels.
