Commission, photograph the territory of the commune of Fos-sur-mer. Nature, industry, habitat. Several diptychs, including one with a man, neither a fisherman nor an inhabitant, his relationship with this place is poetic. The diptych, with its shifting points of view, recomposes a landscape that does not exist in reality.
