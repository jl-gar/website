When I go to the doctor one day, I see a face on the floor. I took a photograph with my cell phone. It stayed in my mind and I wanted to continue exploring. I walked in the parks around as soon as the April sun was strong and I searched for those faces that appeared and disappeared on the ground. And sometimes in extremely fleeting moments, since sometimes the face was only visible when the wind made the leaves move. I walk, I search, I still don't know what the final piece will look like. When selecting the images, I choose those that show faces with a pronounced human character. The piece also includes a photograph of a rose and becomes a version of an Et in Arcadia ego, except that the myth of a blessed time in that ideal country that Arcadia would represent is far removed from me.
