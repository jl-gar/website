A collaborative project with researchers from the Université Technologique de Compiègne. I decide to visit their computers to collect the images used to report on their experiments. Pell-mell, scanners, MRI, electron microscope, 3D, photos, diagrams, drawings, etc... I then reappropriate them, I make my own images to give an account of this effort to decode reality. I work in reverse, I recreate complexity, I mix these images to make them more and more incomprehensible. The last ones, called Images, consist of large grey rectangles floating on a white space, where in rare places the work of decoding has begun, which is disputed to erase. Between knowledge and loss, the process of research.
