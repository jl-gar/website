# Enlèvements + Jeux - Kidnapping + Games 2008











A group exhibition at Neue Kammern Castle in the park of SansSouci in Potsdam, to carry out works related to the place. In the park, statues representing mythological kidnappings call out to me. Shivers of desire-violence in the royal alleys of a park under surveillance. Far from the contemporary iconography of kidnapping, rapes, confinement in cellars, crimes, sordid miscellaneous events. The desire to make contemporary images of this amorous struggle, of this yes-no.
