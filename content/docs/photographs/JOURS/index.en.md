| [Jours - Days 1997](JOURS1.html)







First opportunity to make digital photographs when I am lent an Apple Quicktake, 350.000 pixels, I think I remember it. As I had worked exclusively the previous fifteen years with a 4x5 camera, the change was extreme. So I was looking for images I could do well with this camera. Pictures in the house in the first place. Then I start to paint them, an elementary gesture with photoshop. A colour chosen for each photograph, it comes into tension with the residual skeleton coming from the photograph, and drawn by the strongly enlarged pixels. The photographic snapshot changes in nature by being partly covered by colour, and time makes its appearance, like days and actions that are repeated. It seems to me then to be somewhat primitive to digital photography.
