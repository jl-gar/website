# Morimondo 2007







A two-week stay on the outskirts of Milan in a small village surrounding a Cistercian abbey founded in 1135 by St. Bernard on his return from Rome. Deserted today by its monks. Photographs taken day after day, a daily selection in the small room of the hotel which adjoins the abbey which is being renovated, result in this piece composed of 7 photographs. I call it Morimondo 2007, after the name of the village. It speaks of the experience of a man today, meditating on time, out of the world and its invading objects. The spirit of a contemporary monk.
