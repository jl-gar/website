Almost forty years have passed clearing the path in search of the works that dot it. From the first black and white essays of the photography apprenticeship period, the transition to colour in large format, the adoption of digital technology and right up to the very last pieces, the world has changed, the questioning and the forms has evolved, and this has been a natural part of the works. No doubt one can recognize in all the series or pieces a small family resemblance, which makes them recognizable, even personal, signed. To make with the closest, the here and now, the support of a questioning on our existence in this world and on its representation in general photographic but not only, the objects, the drawings and the words can also become necessary to make work. Linking complexity to the greatest simplicity, accepting what is given in the light of each day, making do with it, starting from the particular to join the general.
Working always, with a view to later or never, in the silence or noise of the days, it is not what shouts loudest that is the most contemporary, we are responsible for the fragile.
