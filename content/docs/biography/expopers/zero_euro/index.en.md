## Musée départemental Arles antique 

17 Juin – 17 Septembre 2023


It was after visiting the Pinault collection at the former Bourse du Commerce, where so much money was spent on the renovation and purchase of the pieces presented, of which the copy of the Abduction of the Sabines made in wax and destined to be melted down represents the obscene archetype of expenditure, that the desire to create this series of 0€ pieces was formalised. They are all rigorously made of found objects, often thrown away, or plant elements collected in nature. In the past I have made several series with found things, Compositions 2009, Bois graphités 2009-2011, Walls 2012-2013, but in this new series, the logic of a zero cost for their production is pushed to the extreme.
