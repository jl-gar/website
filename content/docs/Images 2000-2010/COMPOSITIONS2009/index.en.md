For a few days, on the way between the apartment and the studio, I collect things that have fallen, been thrown away, broken. They pile up in the bag that I hold in my hand. When I arrive to the studio, I unpack and begin the photographic process. On a neutral background on the window sill, I place one element, take one photograph, add another, new photograph, and so on, until I decide to stop, and sometimes to start again. Finally, I throw away the day's crop. Doing with nothing, without money, without traveling in search of the extraordinary, right here, things thrown away, found, a mixture of nature and industry. Redeemed.
