A project in Bordeaux for an eponymous exhibition at the CAPC. Re-exploration of a territory, the city and its surroundings, a quest for images of points of fracture and transformation. But the word Mutations, which I keep as the title of this series, is very exaggerated. Rem Koolhaas talks about Chen Zen, Lagos, Rio, where the word does have a meaning, but here in Bordeaux, it's rather ironic.
