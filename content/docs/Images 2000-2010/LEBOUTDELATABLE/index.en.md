One day, I realise that the photographs taken in this area of the kitchen, the table pushed against the white wall and on which objects are placed, are accumulating in the computer. It is the place where various objects, lamps, candlesticks, flowers, plants taken during walks, fruits... are arranged according to the days, the gestures of one or the other. And this scene at the end of the table meets the often strong and direct light of the great sun, which passes through the nearby window. This meeting of the objects of a life, with this essential light, is the subject of these photographs. When we rearrange the kitchen, the table is lifted from the wall, no more end of the table, the series is completed.
